PS C:\Users\s31524\RiderProjects\Test2C_s31524\Test2C_s31524> dotnet ef migrations add Init
Could not execute because the specified command or file was not found.
Possible reasons for this include:
  * You misspelled a built-in dotnet command.
  * You intended to execute a .NET program, but dotnet-ef does not exist.
  * You intended to run a global tool, but a dotnet-prefixed executable with this name could not be found on the PATH.
The error you’re seeing means the dotnet-ef tool (Entity Framework Core CLI) is not installed on your system.

✅ To fix this:

Open Terminal / PowerShell and run:

dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

This will install the EF Core CLI globally so you can use dotnet ef commands from anywhere.

🔄 If you’ve already installed it but it still doesn’t work:
 1. Restart Rider (or your terminal).
 2. Ensure your PATH environment variable includes the .dotnet/tools directory.
Typically:
 • C:\Users\YourUsername\.dotnet\tools (on Windows)

⸻

🔍 You can test it works by running:

dotnet ef --version

Once it’s installed, run your migration command again:

dotnet ef migrations add Init

Let me know if you’d like help creating or applying the database after that.

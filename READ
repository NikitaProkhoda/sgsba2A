PS C:\Users\s31524\RiderProjects\Test2C_s31524> dotnet ef database update
No project was found. Change the current working directory or use the --project option.
This error means you’re in the wrong directory — dotnet ef can’t find the .csproj file of your project.

⸻

To fix:
 1. Navigate into the folder that contains your .csproj file, like this:

cd Test2C_s31524/Test2C_s31524

You can confirm you’re in the right place by running:

dir

and making sure you see something like:

Test2C_s31524.csproj
Program.cs
Startup.cs
...


⸻

 2. Then run the command again:

dotnet ef database update


⸻

 Alternatively:

If you don’t want to cd, you can also run it using:

dotnet ef database update --project Test2C_s31524/Test2C_s31524.csproj

Let me know when it’s done — and I’ll guide you with the rest if needed.
